# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using
Machine Learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a major issue in the financial sector. The goal of this
project is to build a machine learning model that accurately identifies
fraudulent transactions while minimizing false negatives.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders.
  It is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% fraudulent transactions.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm
- Logistic Regression

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE
- Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high recall to detect maximum fraud cases
- SMOTE significantly improved model performance
- Accuracy was avoided as a metric due to class imbalance

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
